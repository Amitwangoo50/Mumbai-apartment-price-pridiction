Mumbai Real Estate Price Prediction:-
This project aims to predict real estate prices in Mumbai using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview:-
The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Loading real estate data for Mumbai properties.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training, including handling outliers, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand distributions, relationships between features, and identifying patterns.
Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with different regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Random Forest Regressor) and using GridSearchCV to find the best model and hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the selected model using appropriate metrics.
